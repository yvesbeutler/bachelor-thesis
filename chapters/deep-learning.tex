\chapter{Deep Learning Approach}

An auspicious field of \acrlong{ml} is deep learning.

With the raise of graphic cards a concept from 1960 has become more interesting in recent years.

aims to overpower baseline approaches

\section{Multilayer Perceptron}

a MLP is a thing..

\subsection{Using Keras Tokenizer}

Tokenizer isn't best to create valid inputs.

\subsection{Creating a Simple Network}



recognises persons but no addressess.. needs to have larger parameter space to recognise addresses as well.
