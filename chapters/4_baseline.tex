\chapter{Baseline Models}

A baseline algorithm is a trivial approach to solve a certain task. It's common-sense-based and doesn't include any advanced data science techniques. They are simple to create, but often hard to beat. If the baseline can not get beaten by a high-sophisticated \acrshort{ml} model, the benefit of this model should be considered. For classification tasks with imbalanced data, it's nothing unusual to predict all samples with the label of the largest class \cite{rama18}.

\section{SpaCy Model}

SpaCy is meant to be the fast and easy-to-use \acrshort{nlp} library for the industry. Unlike more scientific libraries like NLTK\footnote{For more
information consider \url{https://www.nltk.org}}, spaCy focuses on getting work done rather than optimizing parameters to achieve even better results.
It's shipped with support for more than 53 languages including \acrlong{ner}, pretrained word vectors, and a non-destructive tokenization\footnote{
SpaCy's tokenization is fully reversible to reconstruct the original text} \cite{spacy}.

\subsection{Implementation}

As the developers of spaCy mentioned on their homepage, it's very easy to integrate spaCy into your project. With just a few lines of code a pretrained
language model can process input texts.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, label={code:spacy-integration}, caption=Sample of a runnable spaCy model]
import spacy

# load the German language model
nlp = spacy.load('de_core_news_md')

# process text
doc = nlp('Bond drinks his vodka martini shaken, not stirred.')

for token in doc:
    # print named-entities
    print(token.ent_type_)
\end{lstlisting}

There exist three German language models which can be used to process text. As seen in listing \ref{code:spacy-integration} (line 4) the medium-sized
news model is used for this baseline approach. The model has a size of 214 MB and is able to recognise \emph{LOC}, \emph{MISC}, \emph{ORG}, and
\emph{PER} entities \cite{gh-spacy}. It's trained with data sources from the \emph{TIGER Corpus} and \emph{WikiNER}. The former has been trained with
approximately 50 000 sentences from the \emph{Frankfurter Rundschau} newspaper \cite{tiger}.

The \emph{WikiNER} corpus represents 7200 manually-labelled Wikipedia articles including the nine largest Wikipedias including English, German, Spanish,
and French. Unlike the \emph{TIGER Corpus}, the data quality of \emph{WikiNER} is only silver-standard. This means that the data is automatically created
by exploiting Wikipedia. Every internal link inside an article is getting replaced by the manually-labelled \acrshort{ne} category of the linked article \cite{Nothman}.

\subsection{Validation}

To validate spaCy's predictions the results need to be compared against the labelled \gls{mobi24} data. Because of the more sophisticated tokenisation
process of spaCy, the tokens aren't comparable with the output of the \emph{mobi\_docparser} library at first. By default, spaCy ignores the points in texts like \emph{Dr. House} or \emph{U.S.A} and doesn't treat the sequences as different sentences.

To get matching sets of tokens, spaCy's default tokenizer needs to be overwritten with a simple whitespace tokenizer.
As seen in listing \ref{code:tokenizer} the custom tokenizer simply uses the \verb|split()| function of
python's string module \cite{spacy-tok}.

\subsection{Performance}

Due to the fact that the model is trained on the \emph{TIGER} and \emph{WikiNER} corpus, it isn't very surprising that spaCy has it's difficulties with
recognising addresses because the corpora don't provide that many. SpaCy gets a mediocre \emph{f1 score} of \textbf{0.485}\footnote{Measured with the
current state of the labelling process (967 messages)}. As discussed in section \ref{chap:accuracy} the high accuracy of \textbf{0.946} shouldn't be used
as a performance indicator. The number of outside tokens compared to named entities is too imbalanced. For more information refer to table \ref{tbl:perf-spacy}.
If both entity types are considered separately, there is a huge gap between the \acrshort{kpi}s. As seen in tables \ref{tbl:perf-spacy-per} and
\ref{tbl:perf-spacy-loc}, recognising only names has a more than eight times higher \emph{f1 score} than address recognition. This leads to the assumption, that the German spaCy model haven't been trained on enough address data. 

If we have a closer look at the predictions spaCy did, we can see that many domain specific language is misinterpreted. Considering table
\ref{tbl:spacy-wrong-predictions}, domain language like \emph{\Gls{Protekta}} or \emph{Mobiliar} are recognised as named-entities of type \emph{PER}. Even
very common words like \emph{Hallo}, \emph{Lieber}, and \emph{Gruss} are falsely predicted. These kind of words occur often before names, which might be
a possible reason why spaCy has its problems with.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|C{6em}|L{25em}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Prediction} & \textbf{Exampe Tokens} \\ [0.5ex]
        \hline
        PER & Protekta, Mobiliar, Initial-Passwort, Weihnachtstage, Telefongespr채ch, Hauptstrasse, Hallo, Lieber, Gruss, Danke \\ [0.5ex]
        \hline
        LOC & Kundenportal, Mobirama, Geb채udeversicherung, Webbrowser, www.mobiliar.ch/login, Sicherheitsgr체nden, Datenschutzgr체nden, Mobiltelefon \\ [1ex]
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Examples of false spaCy predictions}
    \label{tbl:spacy-wrong-predictions}
\end{table}

It's very irritating that spaCy predicts URLs as addresses. These tokens follow a specific pattern and could be easily recognised by a simple
regular expression. Unlike falsely predicted names, the most common mispredictions for addresses cannot be grouped together easily. The tokens are
often insurance related, but they seem to be distributed randomly.

\subsection{Conclusion}

SpaCy keeps what it promises. It's the easy-to-use library for processing texts. Within less than ten lines of code a fully working \acrlong{ner} can
be used to understand natural language. SpaCy's performance depends on the underlying model and data to be applied to. According to the official website the medium-sized German
model should achieve an overall \emph{f-score} of more than \textbf{0.834} \cite{spacy}. This score nearly doubles the score spaCy achieved while
processing the \gls{mobi24} data.

The library offers to do a retraining with an individual labelled corpus. This would make the model familiar with the insurance context. It's uncertain
how much the performance would improve. Due to limited time resources the spaCy approach isn't developed further. But the spaCy model can be used as a baseline model.

\section{Basic Lookup Model}
\label{chap:regex-model}
A written language consists of a word set and a rules set to describe how single words can be combined together to form larger constructs
like sentences or even texts. Every language follows a specific pattern which changes over time. In information technology, there exist
regular expressions\footnote{Patterns for defining character sequences used for search, replace or validation operations} which are very useful
to locate patterns inside text.

A basic implementation of a regular expression based algorithm for \acrlong{ner} may sound very costly if you have to define every language rule
as a regular expression. But it can be simplified by the use of reference data. This kind of data are called dictionaries and let you lookup
certain words to classify them according to the dictionary they are part of. This seems to be a very solid basis for classifying text. But because
of word ambiguity it's very important to define how to proceed if a term occurs in multiple dictionaries and not to simply rely on them.

\subsection{Basic Dictionary Lookup}

This basic approach starts with a simple dictionary lookup. Data scientists at Swiss Mobiliar created two dictionaries containing first and last names.
These lists are filled with a large amount of names due to different varieties of a single name and the different cultures people come from nowadays.
Together there are more than 140.000 names present.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, label={code:regex-dict-lookup}, caption=Simple dictionary lookup]
import pandas as pd

first_names = pd.read_csv('./dictionaries/firstnames.csv', header=None, encoding='cp1252')[0]

def predict(token):
    if token in first_names:
        return 'PER'
    return 'O'
\end{lstlisting}

As seen in listing \ref{code:regex-dict-lookup}, the \emph{pandas} package is used to easily load data from the dictionary with a given encoding. \emph{CP-1252}
is an 8-bit encoding originally created for Microsoft Windows. Both name dictionaries are encoded with \emph{CP-1252}, sometimes also called \emph{ANSI}.

The dictionaries for addresses are manually created with data from the \emph{Federal Statistical Office} \cite{bfs}. There is a dictionary containing
all valid zip codes for Switzerland and another one with every municipality. Municipalities are stored in lowercase with escaped umlauts. This format
can be easily reproduced with just a few lines of python code. Another dictionary with a vast amount of street names is provided by another data scientist
at Swiss Mobiliar.

Table \ref{tbl:perf-regex} shows that the simple dictionary lookup approach only reaches an unpleasant precision of about \textbf{0.146}. Even with very
decent recall of \textbf{0.733}, the resulting \emph{f1-score} is \textbf{0.243}. The lookup model's precision is much lower compared to the German spaCy model,
which means that there are many falsely predicted tokens. An enhancement to the current model will focus on increasing its precision.

\subsection{Enhancements}

Some improvements need to be made to increase the \emph{f1-score} of the basic lookup model. Table \ref{tbl:perf-spacy} refers to the resulting performance indicators.

\subsubsection{Clean last names dictionary}

Checking false predictions shows that the last names dictionary contains many ambiguous values which are proper last names but have a different meaning in most scenarios.
The precision rises to a value nearly four times the original value if the last name lookup is being removed. Though the recall drops from \textbf{0.73} to \textbf{0.4}
because last names aren't recognised any longer. The optimal solution lies somewhere in between where many ambiguous values should be removed from the dictionary. But
this cleanup process will inevitably reduce the recall.

\begin{quote}
    "Herren, Weiss, Guten, Franken, Grund, Juli, Mobiliar, Mobi, Kunde"
\end{quote}

After removing ambiguous values the precision jumps from originally \textbf{0.146} to \textbf{0.432} with a minimal loss on recall of only \textbf{1\%}. There are
several terms which are obviously not names like \emph{Mobiliar}, \emph{Mobi}, or \emph{Kunde} which are removed too.

\subsubsection{Add a scoring scheme}

A match in the dictionary might not be enough to determine the token's entity type. Therefore a scoring system can be helpful to give each feature an individual score.
Names and addresses normally start with an uppercase letter. With these two conditions the model's precision increases to \textbf{0.487} with an unchanged
recall. 

\subsubsection{Compare against multiple variants}

Tokens might be all capital letters or without escaped umlauts or \gls{diacritic}s. It can be useful to lookup for several slightly modified versions of the original token. As
seen in table \ref{tbl:perf-regex} (rows 5/6), this enhancement lifts the \emph{f1-score} over \textbf{60\%}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, label={code:regex-variants}, caption=Creating different variants of a single token]
def create_variants(token):
    """
    Creates multiple variants of the same token for dictionary lookup
    """
    original = token
    cleaned = clean_token(token)
    small = umlauts.lower()
    umlauts = escape_umlauts(original)
    special = re.sub(r'[.,;:\-_]', '', small)
    diacritics = escape_diacritics(small)

    return {original, cleaned, small, umlauts, special, diacritics}
\end{lstlisting}

The newly created set of tokens can easily be compared with the dictionaries by using the \verb|intersection(t)| operation of the standard library.

\subsubsection{Involve the token's neighbours}

A valid address consists of several parts including the street name, street number, postal code, and municipality. Therefore these parts appear in a certain
sequence. After detecting a postal code in the previous processing loop there seems to be a significantly higher chance that a municipality will follow next.

Unfortunately there is no difference in recognising addresses. The \emph{f1-score} gains only \textbf{0.1\%} but the number of dictionary lookups nearly triples.
A possible reason might be, that there aren't that many addresses in the training and validation set. Due to this microscopic performance benefit and the extended
processing time, the changes are discarded.

\subsubsection{Naming dictionary clean up}

There are still many ambiguous tokens which are falsely predicted as names. After a more rigorous clean up of both naming dictionaries, the \emph{precision} climbs
from former \textbf{50.4\%} to pleasant \textbf{77.3\%}. This is done with a German stop words dictionary\footnote{Found online at
https://countwordsfree.com/stopwords/german} which values are intersected with the naming dictionaries. Every match is directly removed from the naming dictionaries.
Additionally the hand-crafted list of mostly ambiguous names (see listing \ref{lst:excluded-names}) is extended to 75 values in total.

\subsubsection{Replace address dictionary with regex}

After improving the \emph{precision} of recognising names, address recognition is still lousy. The address dictionary contains too many unreliable values. Some of
them are really ambiguous but many of them are clearly nonsense. The vast dictionary has a total size of 139 660 entries.

\begin{quote}
    "A1 Ausfahrt Rastst채tte Nord, ABC Kompetenzzentrum, Airport Shopping Center, Aktie, Chrome, Grunder, Kirche, Kleben"
\end{quote}

After replacing the dictionary lookup with a very basic regular expression (listing \ref{code:regex-address}), the \emph{precision} rises to \textbf{0.848} with only
a little decrease in \emph{recall}. This leads to an overall \emph{f1-score} of \textbf{78.6\%} which is pretty neat and challenging for a baseline algorithm.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, label={code:regex-address}, caption=Very basic regular expression for detecting addresses]
re.search(r'^.{2,}(strasse|gasse|gaessli|weg)', token)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Conclusion}

The basic lookup model performs much better than the spaCy solution. With a final \emph{precision} of \textbf{84.8\%} only 15 percent of its predictions are false. But
with a \emph{recall} of \textbf{73.2\%} the model doesn't recognise a third of all names and addresses. For this reason the model can be improved with even better
dictionaries, a more sophisticated scoring system, and superior regular expressions before using it in practice.

As visible in tables \ref{tbl:perf-regex-per} and \ref{tbl:perf-regex-loc} the basic lookup model has the same issues with address recognition as the spaCy model. Because of the
imbalanced data the very low \emph{f1-score} of \textbf{16.6\%} doesn't count much. Nevertheless a good working \acrlong{ner} should be able to recognise addresses
as well. Needless to say that the actual model totally ignores street numbers.

All in all, it's much harder to compete against the basic lookup model rather than the spaCy approach. The basic lookup model has a \emph{f1-score} of \textbf{78.6\%} which is much better than the \textbf{48.5\%} of the spaCy model. Therefore this is a great baseline which needs to be beaten by deep learning at first.
